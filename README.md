# Project: Addressing Student Mental Health and Well-Being & Encouraging Parental Involvement in a Child's Education

This project leverages three key datasets to explore the impact of Student mental health and Parental Involvement. The first dataset examines the relationship between mental health and CGPA among university students through a survey. The second dataset provides detailed information on 2,392 high school students, including demographics, study habits, and academic performance, with a focus on grade classification. The third dataset analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of 1,182 individuals from educational institutions in Delhi-NCR, India. Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of the factors influencing student well-being and academic success.

Flow:
1. Mental Health of Students
2. Factors Affecting Students Mental Health
3. How Parental involvement can balance Students' mental health?
4. After the Covid-19 pandemic, what are we facing?
5. Conclusion


## 1. Mental Health of Students
Mental health refers to emotions and how you approach situations in life. With good or healthy mental health, you’ll be able to approach challenges, minimize stress, and overcome obstacles. Your mental health will also impact how you socialize and your motivation concerning your academics.

Mental health problems can affect many areas of students’ lives, reducing their quality of life, academic achievement, physical health, and satisfaction with the college experience, and negatively impacting relationships with friends and family members. These issues can also have long-term consequences for students, affecting their future employment, earning potential, and overall health

## 2. Factors Affecting Students Mental Health
After analyzing the '**Student Mental Health**' dataset, these are the features which are mainly contributing to the learning of Mental Health Analysis:

From this, we get to know how much mental stress was given by the students in their courses. 

## 3. How Parental involvement can balance Students' mental health?
By analyzing '**Students Performance Dataset**', we are getting Important Features w.r.t 'GradeClass' like this

Absences           0.469150
StudyTimeWeekly    0.191713
ParentalSupport    0.069698

While utilizing all the features, we achieve a **75%** result. However, by using only these Important Features, we achieve a **72%** result. This indicates that the primary learning is derived from these features.

There's a really interesting (and perhaps obvious) takeaway from this. If you want to achieve good grades in high school:

1. Go to class
2. Study the material you learn in class

**Parental support** - or the involvement of parents in your academic endeavours - is an important predictor for the **success of the student**. Unfortunately for students, this feature is beyond their control.

## 4. After the Covid-19 pandemic, what are we facing?
- Used the dataset called '**COVID-19 and its impact on students**' to analyze this part.
-  Most of the respondents are from Delhi-NCR
-  Most of them are saying that ratings of online classes are in the range of very poor, and average.
-  We can see increased usage of Laptop/Desktop and Smartphones
-  And an increased involvement of people in social media like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp.
-  During this time, there is an increased interaction with family can be seen
-  Health issues during the lockdown, are mainly connected to these features

Here, we can see that the contribution of the feature called 'Do you find yourself more connected with your family, close friends, or relatives?' is very little, it is about
0.023265. Thus, Mental Health issues are not happening because of the connectivity with your Family, friends and all, rather it is more because of the stress busters, Age, etc making a major contribution.


## 5. Conclusion
After discussing with a few parents and some students, and analyzing all this information, I finally came to this solution, which can help both parents and children maintain safe mental health.

1. Prioritize open communication with parents over discussing issues solely with friends.
2. Practice patience and actively listen to children, avoiding emotional reactions like anger.
3. Recognize that many people are increasingly focused on their phones, leading to less quality time with loved ones.
4. Create a family environment that feels safe and supportive for everyone.
5. Understand that a parent’s level of education does not determine their ability to positively impact their child's mental health. What matters most is the time spent together.
6. Seek guidance from qualified professionals, such as psychotherapists, when needed.
7. Remember that the home is a child’s first and most important school.
8. Avoid arguing in front of children; minor disagreements are okay, but major conflicts should be kept private.
9. Acknowledge that family is the foundational pillar of one’s life.
10. Understand that meaningful change in a child’s well-being starts at home.
11. When balancing career and family, partners and extended family members, such as grandparents, should offer support.
