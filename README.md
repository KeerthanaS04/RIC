# Project: Addressing Student Mental Health and Well-Being & Encouraging Parental Involvement in a Child's Education

This project leverages three key datasets to explore the impact of Student mental health and Parental Involvement. The first dataset examines the relationship between mental health and CGPA among university students through a survey. The second dataset provides detailed information on 2,392 high school students, including demographics, study habits, and academic performance, with a focus on grade classification. The third dataset analyzes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of 1,182 individuals from educational institutions in Delhi-NCR, India. Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of the factors influencing student well-being and academic success.
